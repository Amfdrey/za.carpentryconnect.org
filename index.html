    <h2 id="about">What is CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The main goal of CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 is to <strong>build capacity for workshops through instructor training, and establish a network for the regional Carpentries community</strong>.<br><br>The first South African CarpentryConnect (CarpentryConnnect Johannesburg 2018 (carpentryconnectza.org)) took place in Johannesburg, South Africa in September 2018. CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 will build on the successes of that first event, with an aim to bring together and grow the Carpentries community in South Africa even further. <br><br> CarpentryConnect events are regional Carpentry Community meetups that take place outside of the main international CarpentryCon (CarpentryCon) meetup. The second South African CarpentryConnect will be held virtually and will bring together newer and more experienced community members to share knowledge, network, to develop new skills, and to develop strategies for building strong local communities around digital and computational literacy at universities. </p>
